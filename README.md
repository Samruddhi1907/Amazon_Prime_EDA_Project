# Amazon Prime Video EDA Project

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Amazon Prime Video dataset. The goal was to understand the content landscape on the platform to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making related to content acquisition, production, and platform positioning.

## Project Objectives

The main business objectives that guided this analysis were to:

1.  **Optimize content investment:** Identify prevalent and engaging genres and content types.
2.  **Inform global content strategy:** Analyze regional content distribution for expansion opportunities.
3.  **Track platform growth:** Recognize trends in content release over time.
4.  **Enhance user experience:** Highlight highly-rated and popular content for better recommendations.

## Datasets Used

This analysis used two datasets:

* `titles_df`: Contains information about titles (movies and shows) available on Amazon Prime Video.
* `credits_df`: Contains credits information for individuals involved in the titles.

## Key Findings

The EDA revealed several key insights:

* **Content Type:** The platform has a larger number of movies compared to shows, but shows tend to have slightly higher average ratings.
* **Content Growth:** There has been significant growth in content releases in recent years, with a slight dip observed in the most recent year.
* **Content Quality and Popularity:** Overall content quality, as measured by IMDb and TMDB scores, is generally good. However, content popularity is unevenly distributed, with a few titles having high popularity and many having low popularity.
* **Genres:** Drama and Comedy are the most prevalent genres on the platform.
* **Production Countries:** The majority of content originates from a limited number of countries, primarily the US, India, and the UK.
* **Age Certification:** A significant portion of content lacks proper age certification, which can impact user experience, especially for families.
* **Credits Analysis:** The credits dataset is heavily focused on actors.

## Recommendations

Based on these findings, the project suggests that Amazon Prime Video could benefit from:

* **Balancing Content Investment:** Continue investing in successful genres and content types while diversifying into underrepresented genres.
* **Expanding Global Content:** Increase the acquisition or production of content from a wider range of countries.
* **Improving Content Discoverability:** Enhance recommendations and marketing to promote high-quality, potentially less popular titles.
* **Addressing Age Certification Gaps:** Ensure that all content has appropriate age ratings to improve user experience and parental control.

## Visualizations

The project includes 15 visualizations, covering Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis, to support these findings and recommendations.
